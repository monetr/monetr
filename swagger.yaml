          The unique user Id of the user who created this link. If that user is deleted then any links that that user
          created are also deleted. In an "ownership" sort of way. If a user links their bank account and has that shared
          with someone else; but then the user deletes their user. We do not want the other user to still have access to

          The institution name for this link. With the Plaid integration, each link represents a single bank account login
          with an institution. So if you link your monetr account with your U.S. Bank account you would have one link for
          U.S. Bank, and your accounts with that bank would show as bank account's under that link. Manual links are
          intended to be a single "Manual" link per account, with any manually managed bank accounts underneath it.

        description: |-
          When email verification is required by monetr, it is possible for the client to provide perfectly valid
          credentials in their request and still receive an error from the API. This particular error is to let the client
          know that a token cannot be issued until the user's email address is properly verified. In the UI the user is
          redirected to a screen to resend the verification email if this error is returned.

          The API performs a handful of validations on the request from the client. If any of these validations fail before
          the credentials are even processed then an invalid request response will be returned to the client. These things
          can be caused by not providing a valid email address (or not providing one at all), not providing a password that
          is long enough; or not providing a valid ReCAPTCHA when it is required by the config.

      nextUrl:

          Next URL is provided by the API if the user needs to be redirected immediately after authenticating. This is used
          in conjunction with the `isActive` field for directing users to the payment page gracefully. If this field is not
          present then billing is either not enabled. Or the user's subscription is active and no action needs to be taken.
          It is possible that this field may be used in the future independent of `isActive` so logic should be build for

          How much the spending object should allocate by the next recurrence date. For goals this target is reached once
          and is considered complete, even if part of the total amount has been spent. For expenses this amount is
          attempted to be allocated before the recurrence date regardless of spending. This means that even if a
          transaction is spent from this spending object the allocation system will still allocate more funds to this
          expense if the transaction was spent before it is technically due AND the funding schedule occurs before the
          specified next recurrence date. Changing this amount will recalculate contributions to this spending object.

          of this transaction. But the spending objects allocated amount will never be negative. If you have a transaction

        This endpoint is used to generate a new verification token and email it to an address to verify that the
        email address is owned by a user. This endpoint only works with addresses that are associated with a
        login, and will return a successful status code **if** the provided email is associated with a login and
        the email is not already verified. All other situations will return a bad request, even if the email is
        valid or if the email is not associated. This is to prevent someone from being able to have relatively
        easy access to an endpoint that would let them see what email addresses are associated with active users.
