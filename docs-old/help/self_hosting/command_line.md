# Command Line

monetr is built as a single executable. This executable contains both the UI and all of the code necessary to run 
the API. This executable however has many command line tools built in to help make self-hosting monetr easier.

This document will cover all the commands included with the monetr executable. But may not go into depth on of the more
development focused commands.
