# Link Statuses

Links with external software can have a variety of statuses. Manual links typically only have a status of "setup" 
and should always show as a green circle in the UI. But when a link relies on data flow from an integration in order 
to keep monetr up to date, those links can sometimes fail or become degraded.

## Plaid Link Status

Plaid links can have a few different statuses. But the primary ones are as follows:

- `Healthy`: monetr is receiving updates from Plaid, transaction and balance data might be a few hours delayed but 
   should generally be accurate.
- `Degraded`: In the UI this will show as a yellow circle next to the Plaid icon. With a message
  `Updates might be delayed`. Plaid is still sending data for this link, but data might be significantly delayed. It is
  perfectly normal for links to go in and out of this status over time.
- `Down`: The institution is unavailable via Plaid. This can happen if the bank themselves are having problems or if 
   Plaid is offline.
- `Error`: Plaid is no longer sending monetr updates from your financial institution. This can happen for a variety 
  of reasons but is usually resolved by re-authenticating your link.

If your link is missing transactions that are more than 2 days old and your link is not in a "Down" or "Error" state,
please reach out to monetr support, so we may help resolve the issue.

**Note**: Please do not remove a link in an attempt to resolve an issue with it. Removing links deletes all of the data 
associated with it and can cause other side effects. Only remove a link if you have no intention of re-adding it.
