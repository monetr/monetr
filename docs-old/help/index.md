# Help

This is monetr's help section, it contains documents on various areas of the monetr application. Some functionality will
vary between self-hosted and the hosted versions of monetr. These differences are denoted using
:fontawesome-solid-server: to represent self-hosted specific features or scenarios, and :fontawesome-solid-cloud: to
designate hosted features.

??? note

    monetr is currently in beta, and is subject to significant changes. Help articles should be up to date, but
    screenshots might not be. If you notice things aren't quite right, please open an issue on our GitHub.
