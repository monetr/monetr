# Expenses

Expenses are used to budget for things that happen on a regular basis. Like a subscription to your favorite 
streaming service, or a weekly grocery run. Expenses happen on set intervals, so monetr will fund them ahead of when 
you need to spend the money. Making sure that you will have enough when that expense is needed.

## Example

Lets say you get paid every other week on Friday. That means you're getting paid roughly twice a month on average. 
If you have an expense that is due once a month. monetr will take half of that expense's cost out of each of your 
checks and put it aside. This way the amount needed is ready the day its due, and the amount you budget for each 
paycheck is consistent and predictable.
