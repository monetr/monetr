// myownsanity is a utility package that contains several helper functions that
// may exist in the Go runtime or may not. Most of these functions are small
// simple helpers that just remove some of the boilerplate go code that is
// normally required. As functions do become available in go's actual runtime
// these functions are deprecated.
package myownsanity
