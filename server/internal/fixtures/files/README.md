# Fixture Files

This directory contains sample files used for various tests in monetr. These files have been scrubbed to remove any
sensitive data but are legitimate files that can be used to test the functionality of various features in monetr. At the
time of writing this, OFX files are present to show exports of OFX data at two different points in time for a single
account.
