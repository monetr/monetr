## 1. Our Services

The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in
any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject
us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access
the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local
laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be
subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would violate the

## 15. Term And Termination

These Legal Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION
OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO
AND USE OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING BLOCKING CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR COVENANT CONTAINED IN THESE LEGAL TERMS OR

## 17. Governing Law

These Legal Terms and your use of the Services are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Minnesota applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of Minnesota, without regard to
its conflict of law principles.

## 18. Dispute Resolution

**Informal Negotiations**

To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a
"Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the
"Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below)
informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written
notice from one Party to the other Party.

**Binding Arbitration**

If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes
expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT
THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and
conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate,
the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at
the [American Arbitration Association (AAA) website](http://www.adr.org). Your arbitration fees and your share of
arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer
Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.
The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator
will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The
arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where
otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Chisago County,
Minnesota. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
arbitrator.

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in
the  state and federal courts located in Chisago County, Minnesota, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all
defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state
and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and
the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.

In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one (1)
years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party
will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable
and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above,
and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

**Restrictions**

The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full
extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or
authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there
is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general
public or any other persons.

**Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration**

The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations
binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the
intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction
within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
court.

## 19. Corrections

There may be information on the Services that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including
descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information. We reserve the right to correct any errors,
inaccuracies, or omissions and to change or update the information on the Services at any time, without prior notice.
