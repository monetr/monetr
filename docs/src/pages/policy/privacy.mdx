categories of sensitive information:

- **Financial Data:** This includes information such as account numbers, transaction histories, and balances. Financial
  data can be provided in the following ways:
  - **Via Plaid (Third-Party Integration):** To provide certain services, we utilize Plaid, a third-party service that
    facilitates secure connections to your financial accounts. Data is shared with Plaid only on an opt-in basis,
    requiring your explicit consent. You must authenticate and authorize Plaid to access your financial information for
    data retrieval or sharing to occur. For more details on Plaid's data handling practices, please review their
    [Privacy Policy](https://plaid.com/legal/).
  - **Manually by You:** Financial data may also be provided directly by you, either through manual entry or by

    with us.

**Payment Data:** If you choose to make purchases, we may collect data necessary to process your payment, such as your
payment instrument number and associated security code. All payment data is handled and stored by Stripe. You can find

For certain types of information, such as billing or payment details, we rely on you to provide accurate and complete
information to process transactions and maintain your account.

### 1.3. Information from Other Sources

**_In Short:_** _We may collect limited data from public sources to enhance your experience and provide accurate
information._

In some cases, we may use publicly available information to improve our Services. This includes:

- **Public databases**: We may access publicly available information, such as a merchant’s website or similar resources,
to provide additional context for a transaction (e.g., verifying the merchant’s name or categorizing a transaction).

This data is used solely to enhance the accuracy and functionality of our Services. It is not directly related to your
personal information and is only processed to improve your experience.

We do not source data from marketing partners, affiliates, or third-party advertisers.

## 2. How Do We Process Your Information?

**_In Short:_** _We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you,
ensure security and fraud prevention, and comply with legal obligations. We will never share your information without
your direct consent._

**We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services,
including:**

- **To facilitate account creation and authentication and manage user accounts.** We may process your information so you
  can create and log in to your account, as well as maintain its functionality.

- **To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to you.** We may process your information to provide you with the
  requested service.

- **To request feedback.** We may process your information to request feedback and communicate with you about your use
  of our Services.

- **To protect our Services.** We may process your information as part of our efforts to keep our Services safe and
  secure, including fraud monitoring and prevention.

- **To evaluate and improve our Services and your experience.** We may process your information to identify usage
  trends, evaluate product performance, and improve the features and functionality of our Services. However, your
  information will never be shared externally, even in anonymized form, without your explicit consent.

**Note on Aggregate Metrics:** We may use aggregate, identityless data—such as the total number of active users or
general platform statistics—for public communication, marketing, or internal analysis. This data does not include any
information that could identify you or any other user.

## 3. When and With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?

**_In Short:_** _We do not share your personal information with third parties except when absolutely necessary to
provide the Services you request._

We are committed to maintaining your privacy and will only share your personal information in the following situations:

- **Service Providers.** We may share information with trusted third-party service providers who assist in delivering
  the functionality of our Services (e.g., payment processing via Stripe or secure data integrations via Plaid).

  **Note:** Sharing financial data with Plaid is entirely optional and requires your explicit consent. You must
  authenticate and authorize the connection to Plaid before any data is retrieved or shared. If you choose not to connect
  with Plaid, this will not limit your ability to use our Services, as manual data entry and file uploads are supported.

- **Legal Obligations.** We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests,
  such as subpoenas or court orders.

We will never sell, rent, or share your personal information for marketing, advertising, or other unrelated purposes
without your explicit consent.

## 4. Do We Use Cookies And Other Tracking Technologies?

**_In Short:_** _We use cookies only for essential functionality, such as authentication and customer support. We do not
use cookies for analytics or advertising._

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to facilitate certain essential functions when you interact with
our Services. Specifically, we use cookies to:

- Enable authentication and secure access to your account.
- Provide customer support and maintain the functionality of our Services

**Customer Support Cookies:** We use [Chatwoot](https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot), a self-hosted customer support
application. Chatwoot uses cookies to maintain chat session continuity, ensuring a seamless support experience. These
cookies are used solely to provide customer support and do not track your activity outside the support chat.

**Analytics Without Cookies:**  We use [Umami](https://github.com/umami-software/umami), a privacy-focused, cookieless,
and self-hosted analytics solution. Umami collects anonymous usage data to help us improve our Services. No personal
data is ever collected, and no data is shared externally.

**No Advertising or Third-Party Tracking:**  We do not permit third-party services to use tracking technologies on our
platform for advertising, targeting, or analytics purposes. Your interactions with our Services are never shared with
advertisers or external analytics providers.

If you have any questions about our use of cookies or tracking technologies, please contact us at
[support@monetr.app](mailto:support@monetr.app).

## 5. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?

**_In Short:_** _We retain your information only as long as necessary to provide our Services, comply with legal
obligations, or fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. Once it is no longer needed, we securely delete
or anonymize it._

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy
Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days past
the termination of the user's account.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored
in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
until deletion is possible.

## 6. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?

**_In Short:_** _We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security
measures._

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information,
no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so
we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to
defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.
You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

## 7. Do We Collect Information From Minors?

**_In Short:_** _We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age._

We do not knowingly collect or solicit data from, or market to, children under 18 years of age. By using the Services,
you represent that you are at least 18 years old or are the parent or guardian of a minor and consent to their use of
the Services.

If we learn that personal information from users under the age of 18 has been collected, we will deactivate the account
and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have
collected from children under 18, please contact us at [support@monetr.app](mailto:support@monetr.app).

## 8. What Are Your Privacy Rights?

**_In Short:_**  _You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or
state of residence._

**Withdrawing your consent:** If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be
express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "[How
Can You Contact Us About This Notice?](#12-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice)" below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when
applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful
processing grounds other than consent.

**Account Information**

If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:

- Log in to your account settings and update your user account.
- Contact us using the contact information provided.

Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active
databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any
investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

**Cookies and similar technologies:** Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can
usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject
cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at
[support@monetr.app](mailto:support@monetr.app).

## 9. Controls For Do-Not-Track Features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or
setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an
industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

## 10. Do United States Residents Have Specific Privacy Rights?

**_In Short:_** _If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,
Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the
right to request access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have
processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to
withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information. These rights may be limited in some circumstances
by applicable law. More information is provided below._
