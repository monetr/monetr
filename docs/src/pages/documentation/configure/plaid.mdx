# Plaid Configuration

This guide shows you how to configure Plaid for your self hosted monetr instance. This will require Plaid credentials
which can be obtained by following the [Plaid Credentials Guide](../development/credentials#plaid).

```yaml filename="config.yaml"

  clientId: "..."
  clientSecret: "..."
  environment: "<https://sandbox.plaid.com|https://production.plaid.com>"
  webhooksEnabled: <true|false>
  webhooksDomain: "..."
  oauthDomain: "..."
  countryCodes: ["US", ...]
```

## Non-US Countries

monetr supports connecting to non-US countries via Plaid. However, Plaid has special requirements for connecting to
countries outside the US. For self-hosted environments you will need to contact Plaid support in order to have
additional countries enabled for your account. EU based countries as well as the UK has special requirements and it may
not be possible to connect to them via Plaid given those requirements.

You may also need to customize your link experience inside Plaid to enable additional countries. You can do this on the
[dashboard.plaid.com/link](https://dashboard.plaid.com/link) page.

You can then click on the **Gear** icon in at the top of the page on the right side to see what countries are currently
configured for your link.
