# Redis Configuration

monetr can use any cache that is compatible with Redis's wire protocol. In the provided Docker compose file, local
development environment as well as in production [valkey](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey) is used.

monetr only caches a few things, and for self-hosting it may not even be necessary to run a dedicated cache at this time
as monetr also leverages [miniredis](https://github.com/alicebob/miniredis) when a cache server has not been configured.
For a single monetr server this embedded "Redis" is sufficient.

To configure a dedicated cache server though:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
redis:
  enabled: <true|false> # If this is set to false then miniredis is used.
  address: "localhost"
  port: 6379
```
