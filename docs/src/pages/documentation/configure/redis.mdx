# Redis Configuration

monetr can use any cache that is compatible with Redis's wire protocol. In the provided Docker compose file, local
development environment as well as in production [valkey](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey) is used.

monetr only caches a few things, and for self-hosting it may not even be necessary to run a dedicated cache at this time
as monetr also leverages [miniredis](https://github.com/alicebob/miniredis) when a cache server has not been configured.
For a single monetr server this embedded "Redis" is sufficient.

To configure a dedicated cache server though:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
redis:
  enabled: <true|false> # If this is set to false then miniredis is used.
  address: "localhost"
  port: 6379
```

| `enabled` | Boolean  | `false`     | Enable a dedicated cache server, if this is set to `false` then an embedded miniredis instance is used instead. |
| `address` | String   |             | The IP, or DNS resolvable address of your Redis-compatible cache server.                                        |
| `port`    | Number   | `6379`      | Port that the Redis-compatible cache server can be reached at.                                                  |

<Callout type="info">
  monetr does not support credentials or TLS for this cache server at this time. Sensitive information is never cached
  on this server and the use of the cache is purely for performance.
