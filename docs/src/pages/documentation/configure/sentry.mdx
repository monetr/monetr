# Sentry Configuration

monetr uses [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) for error reporting and performance monitoring. But it
supports using a separate DSN for the frontend versus the backend. Or you can use the same DSN for both.

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
sentry:
  enabled: <true|false>
  dsn: "..."           # DSN for the backend, API and job runner.
  externalDsn: "..."   # DSN that is used by the frontend at runtime.
  sampleRate: 1.0      # Sample rate for errors
  traceSampleRate: 1.0 # Sample rate for performance traces
  securityHeaderEndpoint: "..."
```

| ---                      | ---      | ---         | ---                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `enabled`                | Boolean  | `false`     | Enable the Sentry integration with monetr, allowing you to gather debug information about your instance if you run into any issue.                                                                                          |
| `dsn`                    | String   |             | Specify the DSN that the backend will use for its errors and performance traces. This DSN is never exposed publically.                                                                                                      |
| `externalDsn`            | String   |             | Specify the DSN that the frontend portion of monetr will use. **Note**: This DSN is publically visible even without authentication as it is loaded into the `index.html` content served for the frontend with each request. |
| `sampleRate`             | Float    | `1.0`       | Specify a sample rate for errors, `1.0` would be sampling every error where `0.0` would be sampling none of them.                                                                                                           |
| `traceSampleRate`        | Float    | `1.0`       | Specify a sample rate for performance traces, `1.0` would be sampling every transaction span where `0.0` would be sampling none of them.                                                                                    |
| `securityHeaderEndpoint` | String   |             | Specify a sentry URL to report CSP violations to. monetr enforces a strict CSP policy by default.                                                                                                                           |
