# PostgreSQL Configuration

monetr's primary database is PostgreSQL and is required in order for monetr to run. monetr also uses PostgreSQL as a
basic pub-sub system via `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` commands.

Officially monetr supports PostgreSQL version 16 and higher.

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
postgresql:
  address: "localhost"
  port: 5432
  username: "monetr"
  password: "..."
  database: "monetr"
  insecureSkipVerify: false
  caCertificatePath: "</tls/ca.cert>"
  keyPath: "</tls/tls.key>"
  certificatePath: "</tls/tls.cert>"
```

<Callout type="info">
  monetr does watch for certificate changes on the filesystem to facilitate certificate rotation without needing to
  restart the server. However this functionality does not always work and should not be relied on at this time.

## Database Migrations

The provided Docker Compose file will automatically run database migrations on startup as needed. However if you want to
run the migrations manually you can remove the `--migrate` flag from the serve command in the compose file.

To run database migrations manually run the following command:

```shell filename="Run Database Migrations"
monetr database migrate
```

To see the current database schema version run the following command:

```shell filename="Database Schema Version"
monetr database version
```
