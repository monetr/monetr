# Lunch Flow

By default Lunch Flow is enabled for all **self-hosted** monetr deployments. This means that when you add a new link or
budget to monetr you will be presented with the option to connect to an institution via Lunch Flow. For information on
setting up Lunch Flow you can follow the guide here: [Integrate with Lunch Flow](/documentation/use/lunch_flow)

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
lunchflow:
  enabled: true
```
