# Security Configuration

monetr uses [Platform-Agnostic Security Tokens](https://paseto.io/) for authentication as well as other stateless
validation. For example, the links sent for resetting your password via email include a short-lived token signed and
scoped exclusively for password resets. This is all done using
[github.com/aidantwoods/go-paseto](https://github.com/aidantwoods/go-paseto).

These tokens require an [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519) public and private key. If you are using
the provided Docker compose file then these are generated automatically the first time the server starts (via
`--generate-certificates` on the serve command). The generated certificate is stored in a single file
`/etc/monetr/ed25519.key` in PEM format, containing both the public and private key.

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
security:
  privateKey: </etc/monetr/ed25519.key> # Path to your PEM encoded certificate.
```

| **Name**     | **Type** | **Default**               | **Description**                                                                               |
| ---          | ---      | ---                       | ---                                                                                           |
| `privateKey` | String   | `/etc/monetr/ed25519.key` | The path to the PEM encoded Ed25519 certificate that monetr will use for all security tokens. |

This configuration cannot be defined via environment variable at this time.

## Generate Your Own Certificate

If you want to provide your own certificate you can generate your own certificate using the following command:

```shell filename="Generate your own security certificate"
openssl genpkey -algorithm ED25519 -out ed25519.key
```

To see the public key from this generated certificate:

```shell filename="Get the public key"
openssl pkey -in ed25519.key -pubout -text
```

<Callout type="info">
  monetr does not support certificate rotation for the security certificate. To rotate the certificate simply regenerate
  the certificate file and restart the monetr server. Any existing tokens will no longer be considered valid, this will
  also logout any currently active or signed on users.
