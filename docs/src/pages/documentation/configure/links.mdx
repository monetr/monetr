# Links Configuration

The links configuration is extremely simple, at the moment it only contains a single parameter.

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
links:
  maxNumberOfLinks: 3
```

The max number of links determines how many _Plaid_ links an account can have configured at any given time. monetr does
not currently enforce a maximum number of manual links. If the value is set to `0` then no limit is enforced at all.

<Callout type="warning">
  It is likely that this configuration option will be removed in the future, and will be superceded by a feature flag
  configuration instead. Allowing more flexibility with enforcing limits.
