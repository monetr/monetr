# Encryption (Key Management)

monetr supports encrypting secrets before they are stored in PostgreSQL. Other data may support encryption in the future
but at the moment only Plaid credentials are encrypted.

To that end, monetr supports a few different providers. An outline of the configuration for key management:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
keyManagement:
  provider: "<plaintext|aws|google|vault>" # KMS provider, must be one of these values
  aws: { ... }    # AWS KMS specific configuration, only used when `provider: aws`
  google: { ... } # Google Cloud KMS specific configuration, only used when `provider: google`
  vault: { ... }  # Hashicorp Vault configuration, only used when `provider: vault`
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you are using the `plaintext` provider (which is the default), no additional options needs to be provided for the
  key management configuration.
</Callout>

It is possible to migrate to another KMS provider using the monetr CLI, however this workflow is not documented at this
time. It is recommended you pick the key management provider you want to stick with initially and not change it.

## Plaintext

When `plaintext` is specified as the provider, monetr will not encrypt any secrets and all items in the `secrets` table
will be stored in plain text. This is fine for self hosted deployments or development environments.

## AWS KMS Configuration

The AWS KMS will encrypt secrets using AWS's key management API. There is also an option to run a local version of AWS
KMS for the local development environment for monetr.

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
keyManagement:
  aws:
    region: "us-east1"
    accessKey: "..."
    secretKey: "..."
    keyID: "..."
    endpoint: "..." # Only used in development, but can still be specified if you want.
```

| ----------- | -------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `region`    | String   |             | The AWS region to use for the client. May be required depending on your configuration.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `accessKey` | String   |             | The Access Key that monetr should use to access the AWS KMS API.                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `keyID`     | String   |             | The actual Key ID in AWS, this must be the ID of the key to use for encryption and decryption and should not be changed. If this ID is changed then values encrypted with another key will not be able to be decrypted with this new key. |
| `endpoint`  | String   | `null`      | The AWS KMS API endpoint, this is intended to be used only for local development environments.                                                                                                                                            |

## Google Cloud KMS Configuration

Google Cloud KMS is also supported for encryption/decryption of secrets in monetr. It will require service account
credentials in the form of a JSON file. However if you are running monetr within Google Cloud, you can typically inject
the service account credentials directly into the VM or the GKE container. Documentation on obtaining credentials
magically via Google Cloud will not be provided here.

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
keyManagement:
  google:
    resourceName: "projects/project-12345/locations/us/keyRings/your-keyring-12345/cryptoKeys/your-crypto-key-12345"
    credentialsJSON: "/home/monetr/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json" # Example path
```

| **Name**          | **Type** | **Default** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resourceName`    | String   |             | The name of the actual keyring to use for encryption and decryption. This cannot be changed later as previously encrypted secrets cannot be decrypted with a different keyring.                                |
| `credentialsJSON` | String   | `null`      | If you want to load credentials for your service account via a JSON file, specify the path to that file here. If left blank the Google Cloud SDK will look in default locations on the system for credentials. |

works](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials)

## Vault Transit Configuration

[Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is a self-hostable option for encryption. Vault keeps track of the
encryption keys themselves while monetr leverages the
[Transit](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/transit) secrets engine to encrypt and decrypt data.

When running inside Kubernetes, monetr can use the `kubernetes` authentication method to access Vault. When this is
configured, monetr will automatically renew its Vault credentials a few moments before they expire. Other authentication
methods may require a non-expiring token such as the root token.

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
keyManagement:
  vault:
    keyID: monetr
    authMethod: kubernetes
    role: monetr
    endpoint: https://your-vault-server.local:8200
    tlsCertificatePath: /etc/monetr/vault/tls.crt
    tlsKeyPath: /etc/monetr/vault/tls.key
    tlsCAPath: /etc/monetr/vault/ca.crt
    insecureSkipVerify: false
```
