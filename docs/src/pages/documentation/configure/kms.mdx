# Encryption (Key Management)

monetr supports encrypting secrets before they are stored in PostgreSQL. Other data may support encryption in the future
but at the moment only Plaid credentials are encrypted.

To that end, monetr supports a few different providers. An outline of the configuration for key management:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
keyManagement:
  provider: "<plaintext|aws|openbao|vault>" # KMS provider, must be one of these values
  aws: { ... }     # AWS KMS specific configuration, only used when `provider: aws`
  openbao: { ... } # OpenBao specific configuration, only used when `provider: openbao`
  vault: { ... }   # Hashicorp Vault configuration, only used when `provider: vault`
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you are using the `plaintext` provider (which is the default), no additional options needs to be provided for the
  key management configuration.
</Callout>

It is possible to migrate to another KMS provider using the monetr CLI, however this workflow is not documented at this
time. It is recommended you pick the key management provider you want to stick with initially and not change it.

## Plaintext

When `plaintext` is specified as the provider, monetr will not encrypt any secrets and all items in the `secrets` table
will be stored in plain text. This is fine for self hosted deployments or development environments.

## AWS KMS Configuration

The AWS KMS will encrypt secrets using AWS's key management API. There is also an option to run a local version of AWS
KMS for the local development environment for monetr.

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
keyManagement:
  aws:
    region: "us-east1"
    accessKey: "..."
    secretKey: "..."
    keyID: "..."
    endpoint: "..." # Only used in development, but can still be specified if you want.
```

## OpenBao Transit Configuration

[OpenBao](https://openbao.org/) is a self-hostable option for encryption. OpenBao keeps track of the encryption keys
themselves while monetr leverages the [Transit](https://openbao.org/docs/secrets/transit/) secrets engine to encrypt and
decrypt data.

When running inside Kubernetes, monetr can use the `kubernetes` authentication method to access OpenBao. When this is
configured, monetr will automatically renew its OpenBao credentials a few moments before they expire. Other
authentication methods may require a non-expiring token such as the root token.

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
keyManagement:
  openbao:
    keyID: monetr
    authMethod: kubernetes
    role: monetr
    endpoint: https://your-openbao-server.local:8200
    tlsCertificatePath: /etc/monetr/openbao/tls.crt
    tlsKeyPath: /etc/monetr/openbao/tls.key
    tlsCAPath: /etc/monetr/openbao/ca.crt
    insecureSkipVerify: false
```

## Vault Transit Configuration

<Callout type="warning">
  The Vault Transit KMS provider is being deprecated in an upcoming monetr release. If you are currently using the Vault
  Transit KMS provider then please follow the [Migration Guide](/documentation/guides/migrate-kms) as soon as possible
  to avoid future problems.
</Callout>

[Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is a self-hostable option for encryption. Vault keeps track of the
encryption keys themselves while monetr leverages the
[Transit](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/transit) secrets engine to encrypt and decrypt data.

When running inside Kubernetes, monetr can use the `kubernetes` authentication method to access Vault. When this is
configured, monetr will automatically renew its Vault credentials a few moments before they expire. Other authentication
methods may require a non-expiring token such as the root token.
