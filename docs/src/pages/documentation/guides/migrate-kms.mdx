# Introduction

This guide exists primarily to help users if they are using the [Vault
Transit](/documentation/configure/kms/#vault-transit-configuration) KMS provider for their self-hosted instances of
monetr. This provider is being deprecated in an upcoming release and it is recommended to move to OpenBao instead. This
guide will cover migrating from any provider you currently have configured to the OpenBao KMS provider.
