# Build

Building monetr locally using CMake.

## General Requirements

- Node (`>= 20.0.0`)
- Go (`>= 1.24.8`)
- git (`>= 2.0.0`)
- CMake (`>= 3.23.0`)
- GNUMake (`>= 4.0`)
- gcc (`>= 12`)

monetr will also create some binaries within the CMake binary directory, these binaries may be created by `gem`, `npm`
or `go install`. These will not be installed on the host system itself, and are automatically removed when the source
directory is cleaned.

## Building monetr

To build monetr you can simply run the following make command. This will run the CMake configuration and build steps
necessary to produce a binary at `$PWD/build/monetr` (`$PWD/build/monetr.exe` on Windows).

```shell filename="Shell"
make monetr
```

### Release Build

In order to produce a release build of monetr the following flag must be added.

```shell filename="Shell"
# Specify the release preset manually
make monetr CMAKE_PRESET=release

# Or you can simply run
make release
```
