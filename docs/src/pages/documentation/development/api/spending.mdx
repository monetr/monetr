# Spending

Spending objects are used to represent how the user wants to spend their money and how frequently they want to or need
to spend it. Spending objects create an ["earmark"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/earmark) against the
available balance of the bank account they are associated with. This is then used to allow monetr to calculate an amount
that is safe for the user to spend at any given time; while making sure they still have funds for their defined
financial obligations.

## List Spending
