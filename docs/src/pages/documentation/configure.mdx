# Configure monetr

Configure your monetr installation using the following guides. monetr offers many configuration options, make sure to
read the documentation of each option thoroughly before customizing monetr.

monetr is configured via a YAML file, typically located at `/etc/monetr/config.yaml`. This file allows many of the
features that monetr offers to be tweaked and adjusted for your use case, or for development.

The root structure of this YAML file is:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
environment: "<string>"
allowSignUp: <true|false>

cors: { ... }          # CORS configuration
email: { ... }         # Email/SMTP configuration
keyManagement: { ... } # KMS/Encryption configuration
links: { ... }         # Connected/Manual Links configuration
logging: { ... }       # Logging configuration
plaid: { ... }         # Plaid bank data provider configuration
postgreSql: { ... }    # Primary database configuration
recaptcha: { ... }     # Anti-Bot, spam mitigation configuration
redis: { ... }         # In-memory cache configuration
security: { ... }      # Authentication, token configuration
sentry: { ... }        # Error/trace reporting configuration
server: { ... }        # HTTP/listener configuration
storage: { ... }       # File/object storage
```

| **Name**      | **Type** | **Default**   | **Description**                                               |
| ---           | ---      | ---           | ---                                                           |
| `environment` | String   | `development` | Environment name, used by the [Sentry](./configure/sentry) integration. |
| `allowSignUp` | Boolean  | `true`        | Are people allowed to create new users on the server?         |

The two values that are at the root level of the configuration can also be specified via the following environment
variables:

| Variable               | Config File Field |
| ---                    | ---               |
| `MONETR_ENVIRONMENT`   | `environment`     |
| `MONETR_ALLOW_SIGN_UP` | `allowSignUp`     |
