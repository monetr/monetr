# Introduction

Welcome to monetr's documentation! Our documentation includes guides on how to get started, what kinds of things monetr
is made to help you with, as well as information on hosting monetr yourself or contributing to monetr.

## What is monetr?

monetr is a web application focused on helping people plan around expenses that recur. For example; rent, subscriptions,
or credit card payments. It also includes some features to help plan for one-off spending items such as saving up for
something big, or just putting some money aside as a buffer.
