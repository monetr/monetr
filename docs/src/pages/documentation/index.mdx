# Introduction

Welcome to the **monetr** documentation! Here, you’ll find everything you need to get started, whether you’re new to
monetr, looking to host it yourself, or contributing to its development.

## What is monetr?

monetr is a powerful web application designed to help you take control of your finances. It’s built around simplifying
how you manage recurring expenses like rent, subscriptions, or credit card payments. Beyond recurring expenses, monetr
helps you prepare for one-time goals—whether it’s saving for a big purchase or building a financial safety net.

With monetr, budgeting becomes intuitive, ensuring you’re always ready for what’s next.
