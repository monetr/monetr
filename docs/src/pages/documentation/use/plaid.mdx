# Plaid

Optionally, monetr leverages Plaid to connect to banks to automatically retrieve and update transaction and balance data
to make it easier to manage your finances. This feature is optional and not required to use monetr.

## Supported Account Types

At the moment monetr is focused primarily on **checking accounts**. While you are able to add other types of accounts
such as savings or loans, monetr has not built out features yet in order to take full advantage of the data in those
accounts. However features are planned for these types of accounts in the future.

## Insitution Health

Sometimes Plaid's connection with a bank can be impaired, preventing it from being able to provide regular updates to
monetr. monetr does it's best to show this status in the UI but we are always looking to make improvements.

### Updates have stopped

Sometimes a connection with a bank is still working, however updates have been stopped. This can mean that in order to
get the most up to date information into monetr you need to re-authenticate that connection using Plaid. This guide will
show you how to do that.

## Adding New Accounts

If you've already setup a Plaid connection with your bank, then it is possible to add accounts to that connection
afterwards. monetr cannot automatically add accounts as they are opened at your bank, and does not notify you if there
are additional accounts available for connectivity. But if you want to add an account to an established connection this
guide will show you how.

## Remove Plaid Link

If you need to remove a Plaid link for any reason at all, it is easy to do so.
