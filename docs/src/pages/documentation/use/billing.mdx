# Subscription & Billing

monetr is a paid product for the hosted version. However, if you'd prefer, you can host monetr yourself for **free**
(see [Self-Hosting](/documentation/install)).

## Trial Period

monetr offers a 30-day free trial to let you explore all its features. During the trial:

- No credit card is required.
- You'll have access to all features, but are limited to a single Plaid connection.
- After 30 days, your trial will expire, and you'll need to subscribe to continue using monetr.

We’ll email you a few days before your trial expires. If you decide not to continue, no action is required.

### What happens when my trial ends?

- You can still log in, but you’ll be prompted to subscribe before using the application.
- After 90 days, any active Plaid connections will be deactivated.
