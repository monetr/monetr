# Transaction File Uploads

monetr allows you to import transactions and balances via file upload if you prefer to not use Plaid. At the moment
monetr only supports the OFX file format, however it will also accept QFX files but may not support all of the features
that QFX offers compared to OFX. Currently monetr only supports importing files for Checking accounts as the structure
of the OFX file varies for different types of accounts (savings, money market, credit card, etc). More types of accounts
will be supported in the future however.

Most US banks should offer an OFX or QFX file download option, similar to where you would download a CSV file of your
account's transactions.

monetr does not _yet_ support CSV uploads as each bank's CSV format is a bit different, and accounting for these
differences is very tricky if we don't want users to have to modify the CSV into a standard format each time. OFX files
require no modification on the user's part in order for monetr to make use of them.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Sensitive Information**<br/>
  OFX and QFX files can include sensitive information about your account such as account numbers. monetr **does not**
  process this sensitive information and **does not store account numbers in any way from file uploads**. All file
  uploads are **deleted as soon as they are finished being processed** in order to avoid storing sensitive information.
</Callout>

When you import an OFX file into monetr, transactions that don't already exist in monetr will be created as well as
updating the current and available balance based on the data in the file. Accidently uploading an old file will not
cause any transactions to be removed or overwritten, however balances will be updated based on the old file. Simply
uploading the most recent file should correct this.

<Callout type="info">
  **Manually Created Transactions**<br/>
  monetr does not merge manually created transactions and transactions created via file uploads at this time.
</Callout>

Importing transactions is only supported on manual links. Links managed by Plaid cannot have transactions imported via
files at this time.
