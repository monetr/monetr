# Free-To-Use

## What is Free-To-Use

**Free-To-Use** is monetr's way of tell you how much you have left over after everything has been deducted for your
budgets. It is equivalent to your Available Balance minus the total amount currently allocated to all Goals and
Expenses.

When you change a Transaction's "Spent From" it will increase your **Free-To-Use** if you spend the transaction from a
Goal or Transaction that has funds put aside.

The **Free-To-Use** is automatically calculated anytime your budgets or balances change and cannot be manually set.
