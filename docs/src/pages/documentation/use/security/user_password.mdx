# User Password

monetr requires users authenticate using an email and a password. A password that is weak or easy to guess makes it
easier for unauthorized people to sign in to your account.

## Change your password

You can change your password one of two ways. If you have access to your login you can click the **Gear** icon in the
sidebar and then navigate to the **Security** tab within your settings. Or you can access the page here: [Security
Settings](https://my.monetr.app/settings/security).

There will be a few cards on this page, clicking **Change Password** button on the first card will open a dialog
allowing you to update your password.

Once you have updated your password monetr will send a confirmation email to your login's email address. You do not need
to reply or do anything with this email, it is intended to notify users of unauthorized activity in the event that their
account may have been compromised.

## Forgot password

If you do not have access to your login, or have forgotten your password; you can still reset your password as long as
you have access to the email address that is associated with your login.

Navigate to the [Forgot Password](https://my.monetr.app/password/forgot) page. Here you can provide the email address
associated with your login.

Once you submit the form we will send you an email with a link that can be used to reset your password. Click the link
in the email to proceed. If you do not receive the email make sure to check your spam or junk folder, otherwise please
reach out to support for help.

Once you open the link in the email, you will be prompted to provide a new password as well as to repeat it to help
prevent any typos. Once submitted you will receive a confirmation email that your password was changed, and you should
now be able to login to your account with your new credentials.

<Callout type="info">
  On self-hosted instances of monetr, resetting your password via forgot password requires that the server has SMTP
  configured and forgot password enabled. There is an issue to track the feature of allowing passwords to be reset via
  the monetr CLI for self hosted instances: <GithubIssue prefix='feature' issueNumber={ 1969 } />
