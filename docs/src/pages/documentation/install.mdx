# Install monetr

monetr is completely free to self host, if you want to run monetr on your own computer then this guide will walk you
through how to get it running.

At the moment the only officially supported way to run monetr is via a container (Docker or Podman). Support for
additional installation types will be added in the future as desire to leverage those types of installation increases.
