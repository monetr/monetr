# Docker Compose

Self-hosting monetr via Docker Compose is the simplest and officially supported way to run monetr yourself. This guide
assumes Docker is already installed on your system. If not, please refer to [Docker's Installation
Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to set it up.

monetr's container images are built with every tagged release and are available on both:
- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/monetr/monetr)
- [GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)](https://github.com/monetr/monetr/pkgs/container/monetr)

Images from both registries are identical for the same version tag, so feel free to use your preferred registry.

## Image Tags

Each monetr release provides two types of container image tags:

### `latest` Tag

The `latest` tag always points to the most recent version of monetr. For example:  
`ghcr.io/monetr/monetr:latest`

<Callout type="warning">
  **Note**  
  Using the `latest` tag is convenient but can lead to unexpected behavior if updates introduce breaking changes.
</Callout>

### Versioned Tags

Versioned tags, such as `0.18.31`, refer to specific releases. For example:  
`ghcr.io/monetr/monetr:0.18.31`

Version tags are recommended for stability. By pinning a version, you can control updates and easily roll back if needed. monetr's version numbers use a `v` prefix (e.g., `v0.18.31`), but container tags omit this prefix.

## Docker Compose

The easiest way to start monetr is to use the provided
[`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/monetr/monetr/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml) located in the project's root
directory.

<Steps>

### Clone The Repository

To get the compose file, first clone the monetr repository:

```shell filename="Clone monetr"
git clone https://github.com/monetr/monetr.git
```

### Start The Server

To run monetr, execute the following command in your terminal from the root directory of monetr's repository.

```shell filename="Start monetr"
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the monetr server, as well as the database it needs and a redis server.

### Open monetr

Once monetr is finished starting, you should be able to access it in your browser via `http://localhost:4000`.

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Sign ups are enabled by default from the `docker-compose.yaml` provided. If you are exposing your monetr instance to
  the public internet; it is recommended you disable sign ups after you have created your own login.
</Callout>

## Updating Via Docker Compose

If you are already running monetr and want to upgrade to a more recent version you can perform the following steps.

Please make sure to review the release notes for monetr before upgrading, as it will include any breaking changes you
should be aware of.

<Steps>

### Update The Repository

In your cloned monetr directory, run the following command to retrieve the latest changes.

```shell filename="Retrieve changes"
git pull --rebase
```

If you encounter a conflict while performing the pull, this means that some changes you may have made locally might
cause problems with the latest version of monetr. Make sure to resolve these conflicts before moving onto the next step.

### Stop The Containers

You'll need to stop the containers running before upgrading to make sure there are not conflicts.

```shell filename="Stop monetr"
docker compose stop
```

### Pull New Images

Once the containers have stopped you can run the following command to update the monetr image:

```shell filename="Docker pull"
docker compose pull
```

### Start monetr Again

Once the new images have been pulled onto your local machine you can restart the server via docker compose:

```shell filename="Docker start"
docker compose start
```

Things like database migrations are automatically run when using the provided compose file.

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while setting up or running monetr, here are some common problems and their solutions:

### Containers Won’t Start

If the containers fail to start or exit immediately:

- Check the logs using:
  ```shell
  docker compose logs -f
  ```

### Cannot Access monetr in the Browser

If `http://localhost:4000` doesn’t load:

Verify the containers are running using:

``` shell
docker compose ps
```

Ensure no other services are using port 4000. Modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file to use a different port if needed.
Check firewall or network settings on your machine.

### Update Issues After Pulling New Images

If monetr doesn't work correctly after an update:

- Check for breaking changes in the [Release Notes](https://github.com/monetr/monetr/releases)
- Run
  ```shell
  docker compose stop
  docker compose up -d
  ```
  This should recreate the containers for monetr without deleting any data on the volumes.
