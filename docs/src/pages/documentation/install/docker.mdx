# Docker Compose

Self-hosting monetr via Docker Compose is the simplest and officially supported way to run monetr yourself. This guide
assumes Docker is already installed on your system. If not, please refer to [Docker's Installation
Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to set it up.

monetr's container images are built with every tagged release and are available on both:
- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/monetr/monetr)
- [GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)](https://github.com/monetr/monetr/pkgs/container/monetr)

Images from both registries are identical for the same version tag, so feel free to use your preferred registry.

## Image Tags

Each monetr release provides two types of container image tags:

### `latest` Tag

The `latest` tag always points to the most recent version of monetr. For example:  
`ghcr.io/monetr/monetr:latest`

<Callout type="warning">
  **Note**  
  Using the `latest` tag is convenient but can lead to unexpected behavior if updates introduce breaking changes.
</Callout>

### Versioned Tags

Versioned tags, such as `0.18.31`, refer to specific releases. For example:  
`ghcr.io/monetr/monetr:0.18.31`

Version tags are recommended for stability. By pinning a version, you can control updates and easily roll back if
needed. monetr's version numbers use a `v` prefix (e.g., `v0.18.31`), but container tags omit this prefix.

## Docker Compose

The easiest way to start monetr is to use the provided
[`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/monetr/monetr/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml) located in the project's root
directory.

<Steps>

### Clone The Repository

To get the compose file, first clone the monetr repository:

```shell filename="Clone monetr"
git clone https://github.com/monetr/monetr.git
cd monetr
```

### Configure The Server

The provided compose file includes some defaults that should be sufficient to get monetr started and to try out manual
budgeting. But if you want to change anything; like adding Plaid credentials or setting up a proper domain name, you'll
need to configure monetr. The recommended way to do this is to pass environment variables for the parameters you want to
change. The easiest way to do this is to create a `.env` file somewhere outside the monetr repository folder and when
running the Docker commands below, include the flag `--env-file=${YOUR FILE PATH}`. This will apply your customizations
to the compose file without needing to modify the provided file.

If you want to use a config file though you will need to modify the compose file to use one, or you will need to create
a config file within the default volume mount that gets created. To use a config file adjust the `command` for the
monetr service in the compose file to look like this:

```yaml {2-3} filename="docker-compose.yaml"
    command:
      - -c
      - /etc/monetr/config.yaml
      - serve
      # Setup the database and perform migrations.
      - --migrate
      # Since certificates will not have been created, make some.
      - --generate-certificates
```

You can replace the path to the config file with any path you want as long as it is readable by monetr. You can specify
multiple configuration file if you need to by passing `-c ${file}` multiple times _before_ the `serve` command.

<Callout type="warning">
  Environment variables can take priority over values in the configuration file. If you are not seeing the behavior
  you're expecting with your configuration changes, make sure that the environment variable for that configuration
  parameter is not specified with an incorrect or **blank** value. A blank value in the environment variable may cause
  unusual behaviors.
</Callout>

### Start The Server

To run monetr, execute the following command in your terminal from the root directory of monetr's repository.

```shell filename="Start monetr"
docker compose up --wait
```

This will start the monetr server, as well as the database it needs and a Valkey server. It will wait for everything to
be healthy before letting you continue.

### Open monetr

Once monetr is finished starting, you should be able to access it in your browser via `http://localhost:4000`.

<Callout type="info">
  monetr may be accessible from other URLs like the host's IP address, but it will only set the authentication cookie
  (as well as other things like email links) based on the external URL configuration. If you are having trouble logging
  in, make sure you are accessing monetr from the same URL that it logs as "externalUrl" when it starts.

  You can configure the external URL here: [Server Configuration](/documentation/configure/server)
</Callout>

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Sign ups are enabled by default from the `docker-compose.yaml` provided. If you are exposing your monetr instance to
  the public internet; it is recommended you disable sign ups after you have created your own login.
</Callout>

## Updating Via Docker Compose

If you are already running monetr and want to upgrade to a more recent version you can perform the following steps.

Please make sure to review the release notes for monetr before upgrading, as it will include any breaking changes you
should be aware of.

<Steps>

### Update The Repository

In your cloned monetr directory, run the following command to retrieve the latest changes.

```shell filename="Retrieve changes"
git pull --rebase
```

If you encounter a conflict while performing the pull, this means that some changes you may have made locally might
cause problems with the latest version of monetr. Make sure to resolve these conflicts before moving onto the next step.

### Stop The Containers

You'll need to stop the containers running before upgrading to make sure there are not conflicts.

```shell filename="Stop monetr"
docker compose stop
```

### Pull New Images

Once the containers have stopped you can run the following command to update the monetr image:

```shell filename="Docker pull"
docker compose pull
```

### Start monetr Again

Once the new images have been pulled onto your local machine you can restart the server via docker compose:

```shell filename="Docker start"
docker compose up --wait
```

Things like database migrations are automatically run when using the provided compose file.

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while setting up or running monetr, here are some common problems and their solutions:

### Containers Won’t Start

If the containers fail to start or exit immediately:

- Check the logs using:
  ```shell
  docker compose logs -f
  ```

#### Permission Error

If you are getting a permission denied error in your logs similar to:

```
failed to write private key: open /etc/monetr/ed25519.key: permission denied
```

Then it is possible the permissions for your volume is not setup properly for the docker compose. This can happen if you
are using host path volume mounts.

On Linux or macOS run the `id` command in your terminal, you should get something like this:

```shell
id
# uid=1000(elliotcourant) gid=1000(elliotcourant) ...
```

Those two numbers could be anything on your system, take those two numbers and add the following line to the `monetr`
service in your docker compose file:

```yaml {5} filename="docker-compose.yaml"
services:
  # ...
  monetr:
    # ...
    user: 1000:1000
```

Replacing the pairs of `1000` with the values of `uid` and `gid` respectively.

Then try to start the compose file again. This should alleviate any permission issues with host path mounts as it will
make the container match your own user's permissions.

### Cannot Access monetr in the Browser

If `http://localhost:4000` doesn’t load:

Verify the containers are running using:

```shell
docker compose ps
```

Ensure no other services are using port 4000. Modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file to use a different port if needed.
Check firewall or network settings on your machine.

### Update Issues After Pulling New Images

If monetr doesn't work correctly after an update:

- Check for breaking changes in the [Release Notes](https://github.com/monetr/monetr/releases)
- Run
  ```shell
  docker compose stop
  docker compose up -d
  ```
  This should recreate the containers for monetr without deleting any data on the volumes.

### Need More Help?

If these solutions don't resolve your issue:

- Check the [monetr GitHub Issues](https://github.com/monetr/monetr/issues) for similar problems.
- Create a new issue with detailed logs and steps to reproduce the problem.

## Uninstalling

<Callout type="warning">
  This will remove all of your data stored for monetr, please be careful as this data cannot be recovered unless you
  have created a backup yourself somewhere.
</Callout>

To uninstall monetr via Docker Compose you can run the following command:

```shell
docker compose down --remove-orphans -v
```
