# Docker

Self-hosting monetr via Docker or a container is the easiest way to run monetr yourself. This guide does not cover how
to install Docker itself; please follow [Docker's Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to get it
setup on your own computer.

Container images are built for monetr with every tagged release and pushed to both
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/monetr/monetr) and [GitHub Container
Registry](https://github.com/monetr/monetr/pkgs/container/monetr).

Images from both registry's should be identical for the same image tag, so you can use whichever registry you prefer.

## Image Tags

Every release monetr will create two tags for the container image. The example `docker-compose.yaml` file defaults to
using the `latest` tag for maintainability reasons, but it is recommended to use a pinned version and leverage tools to
perform automatic updates. This makes it easier to rollback to a previous version if needed.

### `latest` Tag

The `latest` tag will always be the most recent tagged version of monetr. For example: `ghcr.io/monetr/monetr:latest`.

### Versioned Tag

There will always be a versioned tag such as `0.18.31`. For example `ghcr.io/monetr/monetr:0.18.31`. monetr's versions
will generally have a `v` prefix (`v0.18.31`), but images will not have this prefix in their tag.

## Docker Compose

The easiest way to start monetr is to use the provided
[`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/monetr/monetr/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml) located in the project's root
directory.

<Steps>

### Clone The Repository

To get the compose file, first clone the monetr repository:

```shell filename="Clone monetr"
git clone https://github.com/monetr/monetr.git
```

### Start The Server

To run monetr, execute the following command in your terminal from the root directory of monetr's repository.

```shell filename="Start monetr"
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the monetr server, as well as the database it needs and a redis server.

### Open monetr

Once monetr is finished starting, you should be able to access it in your browser via `http://localhost:4000`.

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Sign ups are enabled by default from the `docker-compose.yaml` provided. If you are exposing your monetr instance to
  the public internet; it is recommended you disable sign ups after you have created your own login.
</Callout>

## Updating Via Docker Compose

If you are already running monetr and want to upgrade to a more recent version you can perform the following steps.

Please make sure to review the release notes for monter before upgrading, as it will include any breaking changes you
should be aware of.

<Steps>

### Update The Repository

In your cloned monetr directory, run the following command to retrieve the latest changes.

```shell filename="Retrieve changes"
git pull --rebase
```

If you encounter a conflict while performing the pull, this means that some changes you may have made locally might
cause problems with the latest version of monetr. Make sure to resolve these conflicts before moving onto the next step.

### Stop The Containers

You'll need to stop the containers running before upgrading to make sure there are not conflicts.

```shell filename="Stop monetr"
docker compose stop
```

### Pull New Images

Once the containers have stopped you can run the following command to update the monetr image:

```shell filename="Docker pull"
docker compose pull
```

### Start monter Again

Once the new images have been pulled onto your local machine you can restart the server via docker compose:

```shell filename="Docker start"
docker compose start
```

Things like database migrations are automatically run when using the provided compose file.
