# Kubernetes

These are some example deployment manifests for deploying monetr to Kubernetes. These manifests are less maintained than
the [Docker Compose](./docker) files provided in the repository. As such, you should be familiar with Kubernetes before
trying to deploy monetr on it.

**Note**: At some point there will be a Helm chart for monetr. However, until then these manifests can be used as a
starting point for deploying monetr into Kubernetes yourself.

## Requirements

You will need to provide the following in your cluster:

- An ingress controller with a registered ingress class name.
- A CSI storage provider (or use host paths).
- A PostgreSQL database.

We will not provide a guide on how to configure each of these, however there are some
[recommendations](#recommendations) at the end of the examples.

## Manifests

### Configuration

In order to configure monetr in Kubernetes, it is recommended to create a
[ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) with monetr's `config.yaml` file. You can find
documentation on building that file **[here](/documentation/configure/)**

Here is an example of the ConfigMap for monetr with the yaml file. Customize as needed:

```yaml filename="configmap.yaml" copy
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: monetr-config
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: monetr
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: monetr
    app.kubernetes.io/component: config
data:
  config.yaml: |
    environment: "self-hosted"
    allowSignUp: true

    email:
      enabled: false
      domain: "" # Does not need to match your `externalUrl` domain.
      verification:
        enabled: false
        tokenLifetime: 10m
      forgotPassword:
        enabled: false
        tokenLifetime: 10m
      smtp:
        identity: "..." # SMTP Identity
        username: "..." # SMTP Username
        password: "..." # SMTP Password or app password depending on provider
        host: "..."     # Domain name of the SMTP server, no protocol or port specified
        port: 587       # Use the port specified by your provider, could be 587, 465 or 25
    keyManagement:
      # Default to plaintext, if you want to encrypt secrets you need to look at the key
      # management configuration docs.
      provider: "plaintext"
    links:
      # Max number of Plaid links an account can have, `0` means unlimited Plaid links.
      maxNumberOfLinks: 0
    logging:
      level: "debug"
      format: "text" # Can also be set to JSON depending on your preferences
    plaid:
      enabled: true
      # # Uncomment this section if you do not want to provide credentials via environment variables.
      # clientId: ""
      # clientSecret: ""
      # environment: "https://sandbox.plaid.com" # Set to the production URL if you have prod API keys.
      webhooksEnabled: false
      # # Uncomment with the domain you want Plaid to send webhooks to, only provide the domain name.
      # # The path cannot be customized and plaid requires HTTPS to be available for webhooks.
      # webhooksDomain: ""
      # List of country codes that monetr will use for the Plaid link, please read Plaid's configuration
      # documentation before modifying this.
      countryCodes:
        - US
    postgres:
      # # Uncomment this if you are not using the included PostgreSQL server in the docker compose and
      # # Specify your own address for PostgreSQL.
      # address: ""
      port: 5432
      # # Similar to address, uncomment this if you are want to customize the credentials used for
      # # connecting to PostgreSQL.
      # username: ""
      # password: ""
      # database: ""
      insecureSkipVerify: false
    security:
      # This path is based on the volume mount and secret described in the following examples.
      privateKey: "/etc/monetr/certificate/ed25519.key"
    server:
      # YOU NEED TO CONFIGURE THIS IF YOU ARE USING SOMETHING OTHER THAN LOCALHOST TO ACCESS MONETR
      # This config determines what URL monetr sets cookies on as well as what URL is used for links
      # sent via email. Misconfiguring this URL may result in not being able to login to monetr.
      externalUrl: "https://YOUR DOMAIN NAME"
    storage:
      # Required for file uploads to work, if you want do not need file uploads then this can be
      # disabled.
      enabled: true
      provider: "filesystem"
      filesystem:
        basePath: "/etc/monetr/storage"
```

### Authentication Certificate

monetr requires an ED25519 certificate to sign authentication tokens and temporary email tokens. You can generate the
Kubernetes secret for this certificate with the following command:

```shell filename="Shell" copy
openssl genpkey -algorithm ED25519 -out /dev/stdout | kubectl create secret generic monetr-certificate \
    --type=string --from-file=ed25519.key=/dev/stdin
```

This will generate a certificate and store it in your Kubernetes cluster. The name of the certificate
(`monetr-certificate`) will be important later as it is referenced directly in the other sample manifests.

### Storage

monetr requires persistent storage if you are going to use the file upload functionality. You will need to create a
persistent volume claim for monetr to use. What storage class you decide is up to you; the following example will use
the default storage class configured for your cluster.

```yaml filename="storage.yaml" copy
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: monetr-storage
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: monetr
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: monetr
    app.kubernetes.io/component: storage
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: "1Gi"
  # # Uncomment to specify a non-default storage class.
  # storageClassName: "your-storage-class"
```

Some things to note about the storage claim:

1. `ReadWriteOnce` is recommended when using a volume mount. monetr has not been tested with any `ReadWriteMany`
   filesystems and while they _may_ work. They may also cause problems that we will not support or fix. If you want to
   run more than one instance of the monetr server you should instead use an [Object
   Store](/documentation/configure/storage/).
2. `1Gi` is more than enough storage for now. More features in the future will take advantage of storage, such as
   transaction attachments. But at the moment storage is only used for transaction file imports.
3. If you have a storage class setup in your cluster that you want to use, and it is not the default storage class. Then
   you will need to uncomment and update the storage class field.

### Deployment

Below is a simple deployment for monetr, it will contain a single replica. Restarting the deployment will pull new
images if you remain on the `latest` image tag. Database migrations are performed as part of the `initContainers`
process.

```yaml filename="deployment.yaml" copy
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: monetr
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: monetr
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: monetr

        - name: certificate
          secret:
            secretName: monetr-certificate
```

### Networking

#### Service

This service spec will allow traffic to be routed to the monetr server pod only.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: monetr
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: monetr
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: monetr
    app.kubernetes.io/component: networking
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 4000
      targetPort: http
      protocol: TCP
      name: http
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: monetr
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: monetr
    app.kubernetes.io/component: server
```

#### Ingress

To surface monetr through a Kubernetes ingress, you'll need to modify the following manifest with the domain name you
used for the `server.externalUrl` value in the config map above.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: monetr
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: monetr
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: monetr
    app.kubernetes.io/component: networking
spec:
  ingressClassName: "FILL ME IN"
  rules:
    - host: "YOUR DOMAIN NAME"
      http:
        paths:
          - path: "/"
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: monetr
                port:
                  number: 4000
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - "YOUR DOMAIN NAME"
      secretName: monetr-tls
```

## Recommendations

The following are recommendations for running monetr in Kubernetes. Some of which are based on our own experience
running monetr's production environment in Kubernetes.

### Storage

Instead of using Persistent Volumes, you can run an Object Storage system inside Kubernetes.

- [Rook](https://rook.io/) and specifically [radosgw](https://docs.ceph.com/en/squid/radosgw/) is what monetr is using
  in production and is the recommended object storage provider for running multiple instances of monetr.
- [minio](https://min.io/) is probably the easiest to get up and running.

### Ingress

Ingress-Nginx Controller is what is used in monetr's production environment.

- [Ingress-Nginx Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/)

### Certificates

For TLS (or for authentication) monetr is using [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) in production. If you also want
to issue authentication certificates with cert-manager you can use the following manifests:

```yaml filename="issuer.yaml" copy
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: monetr-authentication
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
```

Then you can create a Certificate resource for authentication:

```yaml filename="authentication.yaml" copy
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: monetr-authentication-certificate
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: monetr
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: monetr
    app.kubernetes.io/component: certificate
spec:
  # You can replace with whatever common name you want, it is a self-signed certificate so it doesn't really matter.
  commonName: my.monetr.local
  # This will make the certificate rotate every 90 days
  duration: 2160h0m0s
  issuerRef:
    kind: Issuer
    name: monetr-authentication
  privateKey:
    algorithm: Ed25519
    encoding: PKCS8
    rotationPolicy: Always
  # Replace the volume mount with this secret instead.
  secretName: monetr-authentication-certificate
  usages:
  - any
```

### Database

There are a ton of different ways to deploy PostgreSQL to Kubernetes, however the only one we will recommend at this
point is [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/).

If you want a very easy way to deploy PostgreSQL though, you can look into the Bitnami helm charts.
