# Links

Links are used to represent a connection between monetr and Plaid (or potentially some other source of data for bank
transactions and balances). But links can also be used to represent a manual budgeting "area". Links are either created
automatically by following the Plaid workflow; or can be created manually using these API endpoints to do manual
budgeting.

## List Links

This endpoint does not support any pagination, it simply returns all of the links associated with the currently
authenticated account.
