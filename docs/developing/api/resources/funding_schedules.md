# Funding Schedules

Funding schedules are used to tell monetr when to allocate funds to spending objects. They represent the frequency that
you are paid; or the frequency that you would like to allocate funds to things you are budgeting for. Funding schedules
are specific to a single bank account and must have a unique name within a bank account.

```

#### Successful

If the funding schedule was created successfully, then you'll receive the created object back.

```json title="200 Ok"

## Update Funding Schedule

A funding schedule can be updated after it has been created, this will allow people to change when they get paid or when
they want to allocate funds to budgets. When updating a funding schedule it is recommended that you provide the entire
funding schedule object. Some fields can be omitted but may result in those fields being unset. To avoid this it is best
to retrieve the entire funding schedule via an API call, and then update the fields needed and send the updated object
back using this API endpoint.

```http title="HTTP"
PUT /api/bank_accounts/{bankAccountId}/funding_schedules/{fundingScheduleId}
```
