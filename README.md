monetr is a budgeting application that aims to allow people to more easily plan their recurring expenses. It is
completely free to self-host (documentation to come), but requires a Plaid account in order to communicate with banks.

monetr is currently still in heavy development; but is being alpha-tested with the latest release version constantly.

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome, however local development for monetr might be a bit wonky. I will in the future
provide a concise way to run everything needed to develop monetr locally. But right now beware that some things might
just not work right now.
