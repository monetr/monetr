monetr is a budgeting application that aims to allow people to more easily plan their recurring expenses. It is
completely free to self-host (documentation to come), but requires a Plaid account in order to communicate with banks.

monetr is currently still in heavy development, but working towards a v1.0.0 release. You can see what items are still
outstanding before a v1.0.0 release for monetr will be published here: [v1.0.0
Milestone](https://github.com/monetr/monetr/milestone/3)

## Contributing

In order to run monetr locally you will need sandbox credentials for Plaid, you can obtain your own credentials here:
[Plaid Sign Up](https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup). Once you have a Client ID and a Client Secret you can run the
following command in the monetr project directory to start a local environment.

If you run into any missing commands you can run

```shell
brew bundle
```

To install all of the tools needed to develop monetr.

To start working on monetr, you can follow the [Local Development](https://monetr.app/developing/local/) documentation.
Or if you want to just dive in you can run the following command in the project directory:

```shell
make develop
```

This will set pretty much everything up that you need to work on monetr. This also works out of the box inside GitPod or
GitHub Codespaces.
