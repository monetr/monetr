This is embeded at build time for releases.","mac-specific#Mac Specific":"macOS can ship with a version of make that is outdated. It is recommended that you use brew or any other preferred\nmethod to install the most recent version of GNUMake on your Mac. This will not break anything that is already using\nmake, but will make sure that your version is compatible with the monetr Makefiles.For example; you should see something like this for your make version.","configuration--credentials#Configuration & Credentials":"At the moment monetr requires at least Plaid credentials in order to run properly, even for development. You can read\nmore about obtaining these credentials here: CredentialsThe makefile will look for these development credentials and some configuration options in the following path:\nYou can create the file manually like this:\nOnce you've opened this file you'll need to provide the Plaid Client ID as PLAID_CLIENT_ID and Plaid Client Secret as\nPLAID_CLIENT_SECRET here.Please do not store credentials in the project directory for monetr, it is much easier to accidentally commit secrets to\ngit when they are in your project directory. Keeping sensitive development credentials outside of the project makes it\nmuch harder to accidentally push them to a public repository.","cmake#CMake":"monetr uses CMake as the primary build system, it is also used for running the tasks for local development. If you want\nto use a custom CMake configuration you can create a CMakeUserPresets.json file in the project directory (it will be\nignored by Git) and populate it with the configuration variables you want to override. If you want to always use a\nspecific preset when running general make targets you can create a .cmakepreset file in the project directory. Inside\nthat file you can put the name of the preset you want to use by default. Or you can pass CMAKE_PRESET=... when running\na make target.\nCMAKE_PRESET is ignored for some make targets, such as release and test. As each of those targets have a\nspecific preset that they are expected to use.\nHere is a sample of a user presets file with a few customized options:\nThis config specifically changes the following options:\nMONETR_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENABLED: By setting this to true the developer is required to use the local SMTP server to\nverify their email address when creating a new user. Valid values are true or false.\nMONETR_KMS_PROVIDER: As configured, enables a local instance of Hashicorp Vault as\nwell as configures monetr to use Vault Transit for secret encryption and decryption. Valid values are plaintext,\naws or vault. Note: The AWS setting runs a local KMS service compatible with AWS KMS's API.\nMONETR_STORAGE_PROVIDER: A minio instance will be run as part of the local development stack. Valid values are s3\nor filesystem. When using filesystem uploaded files will be stored in your $PWD/build/development/storage\nfolder.\nMONETR_DEVELOPMENT_LITE_TARGET: When working on monetr's frontend only, specify an API server that you want to use\nfor the frontend to talk to. Requires an account on that API server.\nThere are other options here that will be documented later, as well as other options that have not been covered here at\nall, but those options are the primary ones that change the local development stack the most.","starting-it-up#Starting It Up":"With the above requirements installed. You should be able to spin up the local development environment that runs inside\nof Docker compose.This command will also load any of the environment variables specified in the development env file (mentioned above)\ninto the monetr container where the API is running.\nThis command may prompt you for an administrator password, this is because monetr is using mkcert and hostess to\nsetup TLS certificates as well as the monetr.local domain name in your /etc/hosts file.Disabling this will be available in the future, but has been required in order to integrate with Plaid's OAuth2 flow.\nThis will install node modules in the project's directory, as well as start up the containers needed for monetr to run\nlocally. This command will exit automatically once all the containers are healthy. If you want to follow along while it\nis starting up you can use the make logs command in another terminal inside the project directory.","certificate-problems#Certificate Problems":"If you run an issue where your browser is presenting a message like net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID when trying to\nnavigate to https://my.monetr.local then please run the following commands in the monetr project directory.\nOn Linux you may also need to install libnss3-tools before running the mkcert install again.Once you restart your browser completely, this should correct the issue.","working#Working":"Congratulations, you should now have monetr running locally on your computer. The develop task will print out some\nbasic information for you. But if you missed it, you can access the development version of monetr at\nhttps://my.monetr.local.Almost all of monetr's code is setup to hot-reload as you make changes. The documentation, Go code and React UI will all\nautomatically reload as changes are made. Changes to the Go code will not invoke a browser refresh of any sort though,\nso to observe a new behavior in the API you will need to refresh or make the API call again.\nIf you want to disable hot reloading of the Go code, you can include DISABLE_GO_RELOAD=true in your env variables\nwhen you run make develop.","local-services#Local Services":"As part of the local development stack, several services are run to support monetr. These services include:\nminio As an S3 storage backend. The console is accessible via\nhttps://s3.monetr.local when the local environment is running.\nlocal-kms An AWS KMS compatible local development API. This is used for\nencrypting secrets in the local development environment.\nMailpit An SMTP server that allows emails to be sent without really sending\nthem. This is used to validate and test communication functionality locally. This service is accessible via\nhttps://mail.monetr.local when the local environment is running.\nVault Vault secret management and encryption, Transit is used by monetr for storing\nsecrets securely. Available at https://vault.monetr.local if you have Vault enabled in your user preset.","debugging#Debugging":"The monetr container running the API has delve included. If you prefer to work\nusing a step-debugger you can connect your editor to it. You will need to reconnect your editor each time it reloads,\nbut it is very easy to make your changes and then hit debug and let your breakpoints be hit.Delve is available via port 2345 on localhost. I'm not sure what the configuration will be for every editor to\nconnect to it; but this is a screenshot of IntellJ IDEA's configuration for remote debugging.","tests#Tests":"monetr requires a PostgreSQL instance to be available for Go tests to be run. At the moment there isn't a shorthand\nscript to provision this instance. But an easy way to do so is this:\nThis will start a PostgreSQL instance in Docker (or remove an existing one) and make it available on locahost:5432 as\nwell as not require authentication. This makes it easy for tests to target it.If tests are run via make then nothing more needs to be done. However, if you want to run tests directly from your\neditor or other tools you will need to run the database migrations.\nWill run all schema migrations on the PostgreSQL database on your localhost container.Tests can be run using the go test CLI, or all tests can be run using:","storybook#Storybook":"monetr now provides a storybook setup for working on UI components outside of running the entire application locally. To\nstart storybook you can run the following command.\nThis will kick off the storybook development server. You can make modifications to the stories locally or components\nused in stories and see the changes reflected with hot-reloading.To build the storybook as a static set of assets, you can run the following command:\nThis will output the storybook assets in $PWD/build/stories/dist","frontend#Frontend":"An alternative to running storybook to work on only the frontend components of monetr is to run a \"lite\" development\nenvironment. The lite environment only runs the frontend dev server and instead of requiring an active API server and\nadditional services to be running locally, you can instead point the frontend at a desired API server.To start the \"lite\" development environment run the following command:\nThis will run the UI dev server locally and the frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000. You can now make\nany desired changes to monetr's frontend without needing to run all of the services monetr relies on.This development mode defaults to monetr's staging environment (my.monetr.dev), which while it is publicly accessible;\nyou are not able to create new accounts on it at this time. If you want to change the API server that the lite\ndevelopment environment is using you can customize the domain name in your CMakeUserPresets.json file as noted above\nin the CMake section.\nBe extremely conscious about what actions you perform in the lite development environment, if you have your\ndevelopment environment pointed at the production instance for example; any actions you take locally will affect\nyour real account. Any data modified or deleted will not be recoverable.","documentation#Documentation":"monetr's documentation is built using Next.js and Nextra, it can be developed locally using the following command:\nThis will setup everything the documentation site needs and run the Next.JS development server locally, you can now make\nchanges to the documentation and see those changes reflected in your browser.Note: The \"hero\" or interface example on the documentation site's homepage does not work in development mode.In order to build the complete documentation site as it is hosted online you can run the follow command:\nThis will compile the documentation and output to $PWD/docs/out.If you want you can then run the entire site using the command: npx http-server docs/out -c-1.","emails#Emails":"monetr's email templates are generated using react-email. They can be found in\nthe emails/ directory in the project folder. These emails are compiled at buildtime and include some\ngo templating in their output in order to be useful for the server.In order to develop or make changes to the email templates and see your changes, you can run the following command:\nThis will start the react email development server, allowing you to preview the email templates in your browser with\nsome preset values (instead of the go template placeholders).","cleaning-up#Cleaning Up":"Once you have finished your work and you want to take the local development environment down you have a few options.","shutting-down-development-environment#Shutting Down Development Environment":"If you want to completely shut everything down then you can run the following command:\nThis will delete all of your local development data, including any Plaid links, expenses, goals, etc...\nThis removes the Plaid links that are active, takes down the Docker compose containers, removes their volumes.","completely-clean-up#Completely Clean up":"If you want to completely start fresh you can run the following make task. This will shut down the local development\nenvironment if it is running, but it will also delete any files created or generated during development. This deletes\nyour node_modules folder, any submodules, and generated UI code.\nThis should leave the project directory in a state similar to when it was initially cloned.Clean will not remove your CMakeUserPresets.json or .cmakepreset files.It is recommended to run make clean before performing a git pull when working from the main branch, this way changes\nin the build system or significant changes to project layout or the application will be applied properly."}},"/documentation/install":{"title":"Install monetr","data":{"":"monetr is completely free to self host, if you want to run monetr on your own computer then this guide will walk you\nthrough how to get it running.At the moment the only officially supported way to run monetr is via a container (Docker or Podman).

This makes it easier to rollback to a previous version if needed.","latest-tag#latest Tag":"The latest tag will always be the most recent tagged version of monetr. For example: ghcr.io/monetr/monetr:latest.","versioned-tag#Versioned Tag":"There will always be a versioned tag such as 0.18.31. For example ghcr.io/monetr/monetr:0.18.31. monetr's versions\nwill generally have a v prefix (v0.18.31), but images will not have this prefix in their tag.","docker-compose#Docker Compose":"The easiest way to start monetr is to use the provided\ndocker-compose.yaml located in the project's root\ndirectory.","clone-the-repository#Clone The Repository":"To get the compose file, first clone the monetr repository:","start-the-server#Start The Server":"To run monetr, execute the following command in your terminal from the root directory of monetr's repository.\nThis will start the monetr server, as well as the database it needs and a redis server.","open-monetr#Open monetr":"Once monetr is finished starting, you should be able to access it in your browser via http://localhost:4000.\nSign ups are enabled by default from the docker-compose.yaml provided.

An easy way to think of funding\nschedules is \"when do you get paid\". Allocating funds to your budgets every time you get paid makes sure that you keep\nyour Free-To-Use predictable and consistent.You can create multiple funding schedules if you want, like if you want to put money aside for something only once a\nmonth or a little bit every week. Each Expense or Goal you create will always be associated with\na funding schedule though.Funding schedules are unique per bank account though, not per connection. For example; if you have a checking and a\nsavings account at the same bank. You may want to create a funding schedule for each of those accounts if you want to\nbudget within both of them. You can have as many funding schedules per bank account as you would like, but the name of\nthe funding schedule must be unique within that bank account.This makes it easier to have one funding schedule in your checking account, for example. With that funding schedule\nhaving the estimated deposit amount for most of your paycheck. Then have a secondary funding schedule for your savings\naccount with an estimate of how much leftover is deposited there each time you are paid.","create-a-funding-schedule#Create A Funding Schedule":"To create a funding schedule you can navigate to the funding view of your current account by clicking Funding\nSchedules in the sidebar.Then click New Funding Schedule in the top navigation to open the create modal.","when-do-you-get-paid-next#When do you get paid next?":"This date is used by monetr as a baseline for repeating the funding schedule, it will affect the options presented to\nyou in the How often do you get paid? dropdown.For example; if you get paid every 2 weeks on Friday, you will want to choose the next Friday that you get paid.","how-often-do-you-get-paid#How often do you get paid?":"monetr supports a few different recurring patterns for funding schedules. Namely:\nWeekly\nEvery other week\nMonthly\nEvery other month\nEvery third month (quarterly)\nEvery six months\nYearly\nIf the date you selected in When do you get paid next? is the 1st, 15th, or last day of\nthe month; then you will also have the following options available:\n1st and 15th of every month\n15th and last day of every month","additional-options#Additional Options":"Funding schedules have two additional options to provide a better budgeting experience. They can be seen on the details\npage of the funding schedule.","excluding-weekends#Excluding Weekends":"If you get paid on the 1st and 15th, or 15th and last day of every month; then your paycheck may be available to you\nearlier than those exact days each month. This is because deposits are not usually processed on weekends or holidays. If\nyou want your funding schedule to more closely align with when your paycheck may actually be deposited, then you should\ngo to the details page for your funding schedule and enable Exclude Weekends.When exclude weekends is enabled, if your funding schedule's next recurrence were to fall on a Saturday or a Sunday;\nthen the date the funding schedule will be processed is adjusted to be the previous week day.\nHolidays are not yet taken into account, but will be in the future. Particularly bank holidays where deposits might be\naffected.","estimated-deposit#Estimated Deposit":"If you provide an estimated deposit amount for the funding schedule, this will be used in monetr's forecasting tools.\nAllowing you to have visibility into how much is being put aside with each of your pay checks ahead of time. As well as\nproviding insight into how much will be leftover as Free-To-Use the next time you get paid.","estimated-contribution#Estimated Contribution":"Once you have created Expenses or Goals that use your funding schedule, monetr will provide an\n\"Estimated Contribution\" for your funding schedule on the funding schedule page. This number is the amount of money\nmonetr expects to contribute to all of your expenses and/or goals on the next date of the funding schedule. It is good\nto keep this estimated amount below the amount you will actuall receive each time your funding schedule occurs. If\nthis number is greater than your expected deposit, then you may not have enough funds to cover all of your expenses.","funding-timeline#Funding Timeline":"As you create more Expenses and Goals, your funding schedule can provide some high level insights\ninto what your next funding events will look like.This timeline will show you roughly how much money it expects you'll need each time you get paid, and if you have\nspecified an Estimated Deposit it will also show you how much it expects will be left over after\nyour budgets have been accommodated."}},"/documentation/use/goal":{"title":"Goals","data":{}},"/documentation/use/security/user_password":{"title":"User Password","data":{"":"monetr requires users authenticate using an email and a password. A password that is weak or easy to guess makes it\neasier for unauthorized people to sign in to your account.","change-your-password#Change your password":"You can change your password one of two ways. If you have access to your login you can click the Gear icon in the\nsidebar and then navigate to the Security tab within your settings. Or you can access the page here: Security\nSettings.There will be a few cards on this page, clicking Change Password button on the first card will open a dialog\nallowing you to update your password.Once you have updated your password monetr will send a confirmation email to your login's email address. You do not need\nto reply or do anything with this email, it is intended to notify users of unauthorized activity in the event that their\naccount may have been compromised.","forgot-password#Forgot password":"If you do not have access to your login, or have forgotten your password; you can still reset your password as long as\nyou have access to the email address that is associated with your login.Navigate to the Forgot Password page. Here you can provide the email address\nassociated with your login.Once you submit the form we will send you an email with a link that can be used to reset your password. Click the link\nin the email to proceed. If you do not receive the email make sure to check your spam or junk folder, otherwise please\nreach out to support for help.Once you open the link in the email, you will be prompted to provide a new password as well as to repeat it to help\nprevent any typos. Once submitted you will receive a confirmation email that your password was changed, and you should\nnow be able to login to your account with your new credentials.\nOn self-hosted instances of monetr, resetting your password via forgot password requires that the server has SMTP\nconfigured and forgot password enabled.
