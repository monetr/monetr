{"/blog":{"title":"Blog","data":{}},"/blog/2024-12-30-introduction":{"title":"Introducing monetr","data":{"":"My name is Elliot, and for nearly four years, I've been working on monetr, a\nbudgeting app inspired by Simple. I'm excited to\nannounce that monetr will officially launch to the public on January 3rd, 2025. This blog post is my attempt to\nintroduce monetr, share why I built it, explain a bit of how it works, and outline my vision for its future. As a\nsoftware engineer and not a writer I hope you'll bear with me on my ramblings in this first blog post. I'm excited to\nshare monetr with you.I've never really been able to find a good budgeting app. Most budgeting apps I've tried focus on the pastâ€”showing you\nwhat you've spent historically, but not what you have right now. They also tend to roll things up into categories like\n\"automotive\" or \"groceries\". Not easily providing insights into the actual expenses therein.Take \"automotive\" for example. It's not just one expense. There's car insurance (monthly or every 6 months), a car\npayment (likely monthly), unpredictable costs like gas and repairs, or costs that don't fit on a monthly cadence such as\nmaintenance. Most budgeting apps lump all of these different expenses into a single category or, at best,\nsub-categories. But they're still not addressing the biggest issue: when these expenses happen. A budgeting app that\nwould ask you to summarize your \"automotive\" budget for an entire month is just leaving out all of the details of what\nis actually happening. How do you budget or plan for something that isn't monthly or isn't even planned?The better tools I've tried were still rigid about this, maybe they would let me budget more precisely for a specific\nexpense but would still confine that budget to be month to month. Not even providing an option for expenses that are\nmore complicated. But even then, they would still make it difficult to see what was left over today. If I needed to add\nsomething to my budget or make an unexpected purchase today, how much could I actually afford?monetr breaks the problem of budgeting into four different pieces.\nFunding Schedules\nExpenses & Goals\nSpent From\nFree-To-Use\nFunding Schedules are monetr's way of keeping track when you get paid, these can\nbe far more flexible if you want them to be. But for now let's just think of them as a way of keeping track of when\nyou're paid. Each time you get paid you want to contribute some amount to your budgeted expenses, but not the entire\namount of the expense. Like if your rent is $1200 a month, but your paycheck is $1500; you never want to take $1200 out\nof your paycheck for a single expense.This is where Expenses and Goals come in. Expenses and Goals\nare your way of telling monetr what you need, how much you need, and when you need it by. With the only difference being\nthat expenses will repeat on a regular basis (but not just monthly, they can repeat weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, yearly\nor more). Every time you get paid, monetr takes a portion of that single budget aside and allocates it towards that\nbudget. monetr automatically calculates how much it needs to put aside each time so that way you will always have enough\nto cover that expense when it is due. This even works if you have an expense that happens more frequently than you're\ngetting paid, monetr will allocate more than a single expense's amount to cover the multiple times you need that expense\nbetween paychecks.In order to keep track of the spending side of expenses though, you have to tell monetr when you actually use one of\nyour expenses or goals. For this, every debit transaction in monetr allows you to select what the transaction was\n\"spent from\". When you do this monetr will subtract from the selected budget's allocation, instead of from your\nfree-to-use. This way, planned spending does not affect your free-to-use at all.Your Free-To-Use is calculated automatically by monetr, and is how much you have left over after all of your budgets\nhave been accounted for. It is recalculated every time you get paid, and every time you use an expense or a goal. monetr\naims to keep this amount as consistent as possible between your paychecks so that you can easily plan around changing\nexpenses over time and know what the impact will be.If you're familiar with Envelope-Budgeting, monetr is very similar. Except contributions to the envelope's are\nautomated, and a \"left-over\" or \"free-to-use\" envelope is used for anything that isn't budgeted. When a transaction\ncomes through, you just need to tell monetr which \"envelope\" the transaction was for and it will keep track of the rest.\nMost importantly making sure that there will always be enough to cover the transaction when it happens.I have several goals for monetr that I've thought through a ton such that these should not change regardless of how\nsuccessful monetr does or does not become. These are the things I want monetr to be or do forever.","affordable#Affordable":"It is a budgeting app first and foremost, it should not be expensive. It should be affordable to anyone who might be\nstruggling to manage their finances. As such monetr is launching with a $4/month subscription after a 30-day free\ntrial.More than that, monetr will always be free to self-host, and self-hosting will not be treated as an afterthought. It\nis my goal to have self-hosted instances of monetr have feature parity with the hosted version of monetr. An example of\nthis is the Similar Transactions feature, which does not leverage the Plaid enrich API or any other third party\nsystem, it works entirely offline. Recurring transaction detection will also be available entirely offline and does not\nrely on any third party software or API. (This feature itself is code complete, however it is not yet exposed via the\nAPI).","transparent#Transparent":"monetr's source code is freely available to read, audit and modify. The changes I\nmake to monetr are free to be scrutinized by anyone and I'm happy to share as many details about the app and how it\nworks with anyone who is interested.I would also like to share monetr's financials publicly. This is something I'm still working on in terms of how best to\npresent them. Should they be a blog post each month? A GitHub repository that automatically pushes updates on a daily or\nweekly basis? I'm not sure; but I want to be transparent with how much I spend on monetr and what I spend it on. As well\nas what money monetr brings in (if any). But if you're looking for some insights now, all of the screenshots of monetr\nin this blog post are for monetr's actual operating budget as of writing this.","ad-free#Ad Free":"monetr will never have ads. I personally don't even want to purchase ad space to promote monetr. With the exception of\npurchasing directly from an individual or website who respects their end users.","respect-privacy#Respect Privacy":"Your information is your own, monetr will never sell your data to anyone. I've worked hard on making a clear and concise\nprivacy policy that outlines what monetr does with the data it has. But the code is also fully\navailable if you want to see for yourself what monetr is doing. But once again monetr is also free to self-host, if you\nwant to truly keep your data to yourself, you are always welcome to run monetr on your own system.If you've gotten this far I cannot thank you enough. If you are interested in monetr please:\nSign up starting January 3rd, 2025. It is free for the first 30 days and no payment\nmethod is required to try it out.\nOr install monetr on your own system.\nStar monetr on GitHub.\nShare your feedback via GitHub Discussions or via\nDiscord.\nShare monetr with anyone who you think might find the application useful.\nMy wife Leyna, who has been patient and encouraging these past 4 years of late nights and weekends working on\nsomething I love.\nClark Tomlinson & Matt Petersen for being a sounding\nboard for my ideas over the past 4 years.\nSean Sube, without whom I would have never learned the things I needed to manage monetr's\nhosting and infrastructure myself.\nThe entire team who built Simple, you have no\nidea how much it changed my life."}},"/contact":{"title":"Contact monetr","data":{"":"Below are the preferred ways for contacting monetr staff.GitHub: github.com/monetr/monetrEmail: support@monetr.appDiscord: Join Discord ServerPhone: (651) 243-0035","note#Note":"The easiest way to get in contact with someone for support is via GitHub, Email or Discord.

You can read\nmore about obtaining these credentials here: CredentialsThe makefile will look for these development credentials and some configuration options in the following path:\nYou can create the file manually like this:\nOnce you've opened this file you'll need to provide the Plaid Client ID as PLAID_CLIENT_ID and Plaid Client Secret as\nPLAID_CLIENT_SECRET here.Please do not store credentials in the project directory for monetr, it is much easier to accidentally commit secrets to\ngit when they are in your project directory. Keeping sensitive development credentials outside of the project makes it\nmuch harder to accidentally push them to a public repository.","cmake#CMake":"monetr uses CMake as the primary build system, it is also used for running the tasks for local development. If you want\nto use a custom CMake configuration you can create a CMakeUserPresets.json file in the project directory (it will be\nignored by Git) and populate it with the configuration variables you want to override. If you want to always use a\nspecific preset when running general make targets you can create a .cmakepreset file in the project directory. Inside\nthat file you can put the name of the preset you want to use by default. Or you can pass CMAKE_PRESET=... when running\na make target.\nCMAKE_PRESET is ignored for some make targets, such as release and test. As each of those targets have a\nspecific preset that they are expected to use.\nHere is a sample of a user presets file with a few customized options:\nThis config specifically changes the following options:\nMONETR_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENABLED: By setting this to true the developer is required to use the local SMTP server to\nverify their email address when creating a new user. Valid values are true or false.\nMONETR_KMS_PROVIDER: As configured, enables a local instance of Hashicorp Vault as\nwell as configures monetr to use Vault Transit for secret encryption and decryption. Valid values are plaintext,\naws or vault. Note: The AWS setting runs a local KMS service compatible with AWS KMS's API.\nMONETR_STORAGE_PROVIDER: A minio instance will be run as part of the local development stack. Valid values are s3\nor filesystem. When using filesystem uploaded files will be stored in your $PWD/build/development/storage\nfolder.\nMONETR_DEVELOPMENT_LITE_TARGET: When working on monetr's frontend only, specify an API server that you want to use\nfor the frontend to talk to. Requires an account on that API server.\nThere are other options here that will be documented later, as well as other options that have not been covered here at\nall, but those options are the primary ones that change the local development stack the most.","starting-it-up#Starting It Up":"With the above requirements installed. You should be able to spin up the local development environment that runs inside\nof Docker compose.This command will also load any of the environment variables specified in the development env file (mentioned above)\ninto the monetr container where the API is running.\nThis command may prompt you for an administrator password, this is because monetr is using mkcert and hostess to\nsetup TLS certificates as well as the monetr.local domain name in your /etc/hosts file.Disabling this will be available in the future, but has been required in order to integrate with Plaid's OAuth2 flow.\nThis will install node modules in the project's directory, as well as start up the containers needed for monetr to run\nlocally. This command will exit automatically once all the containers are healthy. If you want to follow along while it\nis starting up you can use the make logs command in another terminal inside the project directory.","certificate-problems#Certificate Problems":"If you run an issue where your browser is presenting a message like net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID when trying to\nnavigate to https://my.monetr.local then please run the following commands in the monetr project directory.\nOn Linux you may also need to install libnss3-tools before running the mkcert install again.Once you restart your browser completely, this should correct the issue.","working#Working":"Congratulations, you should now have monetr running locally on your computer. The develop task will print out some\nbasic information for you. But if you missed it, you can access the development version of monetr at\nhttps://my.monetr.local.Almost all of monetr's code is setup to hot-reload as you make changes. The documentation, Go code and React UI will all\nautomatically reload as changes are made. Changes to the Go code will not invoke a browser refresh of any sort though,\nso to observe a new behavior in the API you will need to refresh or make the API call again.\nIf you want to disable hot reloading of the Go code, you can include DISABLE_GO_RELOAD=true in your env variables\nwhen you run make develop.","local-services#Local Services":"As part of the local development stack, several services are run to support monetr. These services include:\nminio As an S3 storage backend. The console is accessible via\nhttps://s3.monetr.local when the local environment is running.\nlocal-kms An AWS KMS compatible local development API. This is used for\nencrypting secrets in the local development environment.\nMailpit An SMTP server that allows emails to be sent without really sending\nthem. This is used to validate and test communication functionality locally. This service is accessible via\nhttps://mail.monetr.local when the local environment is running.\nVault Vault secret management and encryption, Transit is used by monetr for storing\nsecrets securely. Available at https://vault.monetr.local if you have Vault enabled in your user preset.","debugging#Debugging":"The monetr container running the API has delve included. If you prefer to work\nusing a step-debugger you can connect your editor to it. You will need to reconnect your editor each time it reloads,\nbut it is very easy to make your changes and then hit debug and let your breakpoints be hit.Delve is available via port 2345 on localhost. I'm not sure what the configuration will be for every editor to\nconnect to it; but this is a screenshot of IntellJ IDEA's configuration for remote debugging.","tests#Tests":"monetr requires a PostgreSQL instance to be available for Go tests to be run. At the moment there isn't a shorthand\nscript to provision this instance. But an easy way to do so is this:\nThis will start a PostgreSQL instance in Docker (or remove an existing one) and make it available on locahost:5432 as\nwell as not require authentication. This makes it easy for tests to target it.If tests are run via make then nothing more needs to be done. However, if you want to run tests directly from your\neditor or other tools you will need to run the database migrations.\nWill run all schema migrations on the PostgreSQL database on your localhost container.Tests can be run using the go test CLI, or all tests can be run using:","storybook#Storybook":"monetr now provides a storybook setup for working on UI components outside of running the entire application locally. To\nstart storybook you can run the following command.\nThis will kick off the storybook development server. You can make modifications to the stories locally or components\nused in stories and see the changes reflected with hot-reloading.To build the storybook as a static set of assets, you can run the following command:\nThis will output the storybook assets in $PWD/build/stories/dist","frontend#Frontend":"An alternative to running storybook to work on only the frontend components of monetr is to run a \"lite\" development\nenvironment. The lite environment only runs the frontend dev server and instead of requiring an active API server and\nadditional services to be running locally, you can instead point the frontend at a desired API server.To start the \"lite\" development environment run the following command:\nThis will run the UI dev server locally and the frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000. You can now make\nany desired changes to monetr's frontend without needing to run all of the services monetr relies on.This development mode defaults to monetr's staging environment (my.monetr.dev), which while it is publicly accessible;\nyou are not able to create new accounts on it at this time. If you want to change the API server that the lite\ndevelopment environment is using you can customize the domain name in your CMakeUserPresets.json file as noted above\nin the CMake section.\nBe extremely conscious about what actions you perform in the lite development environment, if you have your\ndevelopment environment pointed at the production instance for example; any actions you take locally will affect\nyour real account. Any data modified or deleted will not be recoverable.","documentation#Documentation":"monetr's documentation is built using Next.js and Nextra, it can be developed locally using the following command:\nThis will setup everything the documentation site needs and run the Next.JS development server locally, you can now make\nchanges to the documentation and see those changes reflected in your browser.Note: The \"hero\" or interface example on the documentation site's homepage does not work in development mode.In order to build the complete documentation site as it is hosted online you can run the follow command:\nThis will compile the documentation and output to $PWD/docs/out.If you want you can then run the entire site using the command: npx http-server docs/out -c-1.","emails#Emails":"monetr's email templates are generated using react-email. They can be found in\nthe emails/ directory in the project folder. These emails are compiled at build-time and include some go\ntemplating in their output in order to be useful for the server.In order to develop or make changes to the email templates and see your changes, you can run the following command:\nThis will start the react email development server, allowing you to preview the email templates in your browser with\nsome preset values (instead of the go template placeholders).","cleaning-up#Cleaning Up":"Once you have finished your work and you want to take the local development environment down you have a few options.","shutting-down-development-environment#Shutting Down Development Environment":"If you want to completely shut everything down then you can run the following command:\nThis will delete all of your local development data, including any Plaid links, expenses, goals, etc...\nThis removes the Plaid links that are active, takes down the Docker compose containers, removes their volumes.","completely-clean-up#Completely Clean up":"If you want to completely start fresh you can run the following make task. This will shut down the local development\nenvironment if it is running, but it will also delete any files created or generated during development. This deletes\nyour node_modules folder, any submodules, and generated UI code.\nThis should leave the project directory in a state similar to when it was initially cloned.Clean will not remove your CMakeUserPresets.json or .cmakepreset files.It is recommended to run make clean before performing a git pull when working from the main branch, this way changes\nin the build system or significant changes to project layout or the application will be applied properly."}},"/documentation":{"title":"Documentation","data":{"":"Welcome to the monetr documentation!

The platform tracks how much money is required for each expense and when itâ€™s due. Using Funding\nSchedules, monetr automatically sets aside a portion of the expense from each paycheck. This\napproach ensures that you donâ€™t need to cover the full amount from a single paycheck. As a result, your\nFree-To-Use funds should remain consistent with every paycheck.This approach is similar to envelope budgeting, where funds are allocated to specific categories to ensure theyâ€™re\navailable for designated expenses. Like envelope budgeting, monetr helps you plan ahead and manage your cash flow\neffectively. However, monetr automates the process by calculating how much to set aside based on your paycheck schedule\nand expense deadlines.Itâ€™s best to create a separate expense entry for each recurring obligation. For example, setting up a monthly expense\nfor rent due on the first of the month ensures youâ€™ll always have enough funds available to pay it on time. However,\nexpenses are less suitable for irregular costs, such as dining out or saving for large, infrequent purchases.Each expense is tied to an individual bank account. If a regular expense is paid from multiple accounts, create separate\nexpense entries in monetr for each account. Assign the appropriate amount to each entry based on how much each account\ncontributes to that expense.\nLooking for something else?\nIf you're trying to save for a one-time financial target or track contributions toward a larger goal, consider using\nmonetr's Goals feature instead. Goals are ideal for managing non-recurring targets like vacations, down\npayments, or paying off loans, and they provide more flexibility in tracking usage over time.","create-an-expense#Create an Expense":"To create an expense, navigate to the expense view for your current account by clicking Expenses in the sidebar.Then, click New Expense in the top navigation to open the creation modal.","how-much-do-you-need#How Much Do You Need?":"monetr needs to know the amount required for the expense.

The accuracy of similar transactions depends on the quality of the data provided:\nPlaid: Plaid may misidentify merchants, leading to incorrect groupings.\nFile Uploads: File uploads typically include raw transaction names, which are easier for monetr to process.\nHowever, extra details like location can sometimes cause grouping errors (e.g., grouping all transactions from a\ntown instead of a specific merchant).\nWeâ€™re continually improving this feature to enhance its accuracy.","why-transactions-matter-in-monetr#Why Transactions Matter in monetr":"By managing your transactions effectively, you can:\nEnsure every dollar is accounted for in your budget.\nEasily spot unplanned spending and adjust accordingly.\nKeep track of your progress toward financial goals.\nWith monetrâ€™s intuitive transaction management, youâ€™re always in control of your finances.","next-steps#Next Steps":"If youâ€™d like to learn more:"}},"/documentation/use/transactions/uploads":{"title":"Transaction File Uploads","data":{"":"monetr allows you to import transactions and balances via file uploads, providing an alternative for users who prefer\nnot to use Plaid.
