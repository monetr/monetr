This is embeded at build time for releases.\nKubectl (>= 1.23.0): Kubectl is used to deploy monetr to a Kubernetes cluster.

You should be able to spin up the local development environment that runs inside\nof Docker compose.This command will also load any of the environment variables specified in the development env file (mentioned above)\ninto the monetr container where the API is running.\nThis will install node modules in the project's directory, as well as start up the containers needed for monetr to run\nlocally. This command will exit automatically once all the containers are healthy.

The documentation, Go code and React UI will all\nautomatically reload as changes are made. Changes to the Go code will not invoke a browser refresh of any sort though,\nso to observe a new behavior in the API you will need to refresh or make the API call again.\nIf you want to disable hot reloading of the Go code, you can include DISABLE_GO_RELOAD=true in your env variables\nwhen you run make develop.","local-services#Local Services":"As part of the local development stack, several services are run to support monetr. These services include:\nminio As an S3 storage backend. The console is accessible via\nhttp://localhost:9001 when the local environment is running.\nlocal-kms An AWS KMS compatible local development API. This is used for\nencrypting secrets in the local development environment.\nmailhog An SMTP server that allows emails to be sent without really sending\nthem. This is used to validate and test communication functionality locally. This service is accessible via\nhttps://monetr.local/mail when the local environment is running.","debugging#Debugging":"The monetr container running the API has delve included. If you prefer to work\nusing a step-debugger you can connect your editor to it. You will need to reconnect your editor each time it reloads,\nbut it is very easy to make your changes and then hit debug and let your breakpoints be hit.Delve is available via port 2345 on localhost.

You can then make changes to the components in the stories and see the changes in real time without needing to\nrun the entire application stack locally.NOTE At the moment storybook does not work with the CMake development tooling.","cleaning-up#Cleaning Up":"Once you have finished your work and you want to take the local development environment down you have a few options.","shutting-down-development-environment#Shutting Down Development Environment":"If you want to completely shut everything down then you can run the following command:\nThis will delete all of your local development data, including any Plaid links, expenses, goals, etc...\nThis removes the Plaid links that are active, takes down the Docker compose containers, removes their volumes.","completely-clean-up#Completely Clean up":"If you want to completely start fresh you can run the following make task. This will shut down the local development\nenvironment if it is running, but it will also delete any files created or generated during development.
