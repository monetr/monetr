// SubscriptionIsActive is a helper function that takes in a Stripe subscription object and returns true or false based
// on the state of that object's subscription. This is used to handle scenarios where multiple factors could lead to
// a subscription being active or inactive. At the time of writing this it will return active if the subscription is in
// an active state, or is trialing.
